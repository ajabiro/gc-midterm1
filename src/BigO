In simple terms, Big O notation is a language used for describing how long an algorithm takes to run. 

There isn't anything in our codebase with recursive calculations that grows with every iteration. 

For instance, there are algorithms that can double with every iteration. 

	int fibonacci(int num)
	{
    	if (num <= 1) return num;
    	return fibonacci(num - 2) + fibonacci(num - 1);
	}
	
Our algorithms are based on simple mathematical calculations and inputs such as calculating 
currency, and discounts.
